I can't provide precompiled librery for 1.3 because 1.3 has a bug 
wich make ISceneNode::getTye() always return ESNT_UNKNOW. IrrNewt
EBT_AUTODETECT body type use this function to retrieve the scene node type and 
build appropiate body. Many examples of IrrNewt are based on this body type so some examples
may not work with 1.3 and\or they can't show EBT_AUTODETECT in action

So if you use IrrNewt with 1.3 recompile the dll and the library and remember not to use
EBT_AUTODETECT but force a body type instead

This bug may be fixed in next version of the engine. 
But when i wrote this the newest version was 1.3


			HOW TO COMPILE FOR 1.3 AND HIGHER


open "IrrNewt\include\irrtonewt.hpp" and uncomment "#define COMPILE_WITH_1_3",
then recompile.

That's all :)
